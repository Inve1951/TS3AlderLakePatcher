# AlderLakePatcher
Frontend for patching games to fix Alder Lake crashes on boot.

Uses PeNet: https://github.com/secana/PeNet

IntelFix.dll has to be placed in the program's working directory: https://github.com/LazyDuchess/IntelFix
It is also vendored from https://github.com/LazyDuchess/AlderLakePatcher/releases/tag/1.0.1.

Made for TS3 primarily, but could probably work for other games.

## Usage

Simply run the program with the executable of the game as the only command line argument.
